                    How It's Made

                <p class="mt-3 max-w-3xl text-lg">
                    Most hot sauces follow a similar formula. Take an existing
                    hot sauce, change a flavor or two, and slap a new label on
                    it. Not Antonito's Pepper Company. When you buy Antonito's
                    Pepper Company, you're getting a sauce that's been carefully
                    crafted to be unlike any other.

                        Many hot sauces pledge allegiance to a specific chili.
                        Antonito's Pepper Company is a tribute to all chili
                        peppers. While chipotles in adobo are the star of the
                        show, our signature hot sauce is a blend of 4 different
                        chilis. We work overtime balancing flavors and testing
                        our work to ensure that every bottle is a experience
                        unlike any other.

                        One of the most distinctive features of Antonito's Hot
                        Sauce is its consistency. Most hot sauces are thin and
                        watery. Antonito's Hot Sauce is thick and chunky. We
                        achieve this by using a unique blend of chilis and
                        chili powder.
